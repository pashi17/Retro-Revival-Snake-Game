 How to Play
Controls

Arrow Keys - Move snake (Up/Down/Left/Right)
SPACE - Start/Resume game
On-screen Buttons - Direction control, pause, reset

Game Rules

Eat yellow food squares to grow and score points
Avoid walls and your own body
Each food collected = 10 points
Level increases every 50 points
Speed increases with level
First collision ends the game

🤖 AI Implementation
Algorithm: Greedy Pathfinding
javascript- Calculate distance to food (dx, dy)
- Prioritize moves that reduce distance
- Avoid self-collision and walls
- Fallback to safe moves if optimal blocked
